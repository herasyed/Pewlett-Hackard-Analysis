# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
Using PostgreSQL, we analyzed the Pewlett Hackard employee database to help the fictional company anticipate the "silver tsunami" as many current employees are approaching retirement.
For this analysis we will:
-determine the number of retiring employees per title
-identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Resources
Data Source: departments.csv, dept_manager.csv, dept_emp.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv
Software: PostgreSQL,  pgAdmin 4
Documentation: PostgreSQL documentation, PostgreSQL tutorial, pgAdmin documentation

## Results: 
- Only 2 Managers are retiring
- Senior Engineers and Senior Staff will be the largest demographic retiring
